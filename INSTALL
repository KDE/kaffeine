Installing Kaffeine
-------------------

You need development headers for QT 4.4, Phonon 4.3 and KDE 4.2
(minimum versions) and gettext for translations (building Kaffeine doesn't
require any phonon backend; but during runtime you have to use phonon-xine in
order to watch DVB / ATSC).

Create an empty build dir and do the following steps:
# cmake <path/to/kaffeine/source/directory> <options>
# make
# make install

Useful options include -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path> (installation prefix
for Kaffeine), -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<type> and -DKDE4_ENABLE_FINAL=ON.

For further information look for generic KDE4 / cmake instructions.
