    - localization (see below), full EPG support, CICAM, playlist handling,
      OSD, S2API, broadcast, DBUS interface
  - note: there will be a follow-up release in 1 - 1.5 months fixing important
          shortcomings and also giving time for translations
  - note: KDE 4.2, Phonon 4.3 and QT 4.4 are required to build / run Kaffeine
  - note: Kaffeine currently depends on phonon-xine for digital TV playback
          (due to the used phonon API)
