Naming
======

Actually the application should be called "kaffeine", but it's temporarily named
"kaffeine4" to allow coinstallability (for lazy developers :), as it isn't a full
replacement yet.

Bugs
====

You are welcome to report crashes and stuff that doesn't work the right way.
We know what stuff isn't implemented yet, so please don't report that (ok, I admit
that this distinction sometimes isn't too easy if you don't know the code).

One known bug is that you can only switch channels once (and kaffeine will crash
at exit); this is being investigated.
