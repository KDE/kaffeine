Requirements
============

Phonon 4.3 and KDE 4.2 are strongly recommended.

Naming
======

Actually the application should be called "kaffeine", but it's temporarily named
"kaffeine4" to allow coinstallability (for lazy developers :), as it isn't a full
replacement yet.

Bugs
====

You are welcome to report crashes and stuff that doesn't work the right way.
We know what stuff isn't implemented yet, so please don't report that (ok, I admit
that this distinction sometimes isn't too easy if you don't know the code).
