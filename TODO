- Fix DVB menus navigation.

  On qt4, the mouse movements were sent to libvlc, but, on qt5, only the
  mouse press. That causes the VLC to auto-ride the mouse. Without the
  mouse, it is hard to find the right place to click during DVB menus
  navigation. Btw, qtPlayer, at vlc source tree also has the same
  problem.

- DVB device removal sometimes causes crash.

  Need to fix DVB device hotplug.
