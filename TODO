- Fix DVB menus navigation.

  On qt4, the mouse movements were sent to libvlc, but, on qt5.5 and upper,
  the mouse move is not sent to VLC. That happens because qt5.5 sends the
  mouse events via Xinput2, but VLC doesn't recognize such events.

  That causes the VLC to auto-ride the mouse. Without the mouse, it is
  hard to find the right place to click during DVB menus  navigation.
  A workaround is to disable xinput2 at qt5-qtbase (recompiling it),
  as explained at the README.

  A fix for this issue would be to use another backend for DVB play, or
  to fix either VLC or Qt5. I tried to change the VLC backend
  (backend-vlc/vlcmediawidget.cpp), to add things like:
       setCursor(QCursor(Qt::OpenHandCursor));
       setMouseTracking(true);
       setFocusPolicy(Qt::NoFocus);
  but the above approach didn't work.

- DVB device removal sometimes causes crash.

  Need to fix DVB device hotplug.
